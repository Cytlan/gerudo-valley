Gerudo Valley NES
=================

Welcome!

In 2010 I made a remix of the music from Gerudo Valley in Famitracker for the NES. The video got quite a few views, and when asked if I should remake this with proper NES assembly and a custom sound engine, the answer was a resounding "Yes!"

Given how the original video is 10 years old, I'll take my sweet time with this repo, but if you're interested you may follow the development from start to finish.

Let's get coding!
